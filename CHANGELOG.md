### [0.0.2] Apps

#### API (`apps/api`)

- **New**
  - Fly.io `flyctl` integration in `.envrc` using `FLY_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `FLY_APP` for the `multitenant-saas-starter` app.
  - `.dockerignore` for API image builds to reduce build context and improve cache hits.
  - Production `Dockerfile` for API that:
    - Sets environment variables, copies workspace config, shared libraries, tools, and app code
    - Creates a Python virtual environment and installs dependencies
    - Uses a non-root user, exposes port, adds healthcheck, and launches Gunicorn
  - Gunicorn configurations:
    - `gunicorn.conf.py` (production) with worker/bind/logging/timeouts and security presets
    - `gunicorn.dev.py` (development) with reload and dev-optimized settings
  - Deployment config: `fly.toml` for Fly.io API deployment.

- **Improved**
  - Project layout:
    - Moved `apps/api/main.py` to `apps/api/app/main.py`
    - Consolidated config under `apps/api/app/config`
  - Endpoints reorganization: moved `endpoints/` under `apps/api/app/endpoints/` for `auth`, `memberships`, `organizations`, and `users`; switched to relative imports; formatting/readability improvements across routers and dependencies.
  - Auth dependencies and routers: clearer argument formatting, line breaks, and more consistent exception handling.
  - Memberships/Organizations/Users routers: improved import structure, better validation (e.g., organization access), clearer error messages, consistent patterns.
  - Settings: removed `importlib.metadata` version import; `api_version` now defaults to `"0.0.0"` for stability.
  - Build system and tooling: adopted Hatch build targets; added `uvicorn` and `gunicorn`; tuned Ruff line length.
  - Utilities: moved API utilities to `apps/api/app/utils/api_utils.py` and updated imports accordingly.

- **Fixed**
  - Resolved circular dependency involving `get_current_user` by relocating imports.
  - Hardened error handling in `auth`, `organizations`, and `users` routes; more explicit HTTP exceptions.

#### Web (`apps/web`)

- **New**: None
- **Improved**: None
- **Fixed**: None

### [0.0.2] Infra

- **New**
  - Development Dockerfile for API: `infra/docker/Dockerfile.api.dev`.
  - Additional `.dockerignore` coverage to minimize production image context.

- **Improved**
  - Production `apps/api/Dockerfile` refined for smaller, reproducible builds with better caching.

- **Fixed**: None

### [0.0.2] Tooling

- **New**
  - Release notes generation workflow that writes to `CHANGELOG.md` at the repo root.
  - Scripts for linting, formatting, and deploying monorepo apps.

- **Improved**
  - Updated existing lint and format scripts for consistency across packages.

- **Fixed**: None

### [0.0.2] Dependencies

- **New**
  - Added `gunicorn@23` and `uvicorn` to API runtime and dev dependencies.

- **Improved**
  - Requirements/lockfiles updated with pinned hashes; build system aligned with Hatch.

- **Fixed**
  - Removed autogenerated `apps/api/requirements.txt` in favor of managed build tooling.

### [0.0.2] Docs
